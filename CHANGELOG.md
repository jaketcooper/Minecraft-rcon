## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-02

### üöÄ Major Changes

#### Custom RCON Protocol Implementation
- **Replaced `rcon-client` library** with a native TypeScript implementation
- **Full fragmentation support** - Properly handles responses larger than 4096 bytes using double-packet technique
- **No more truncated responses** - Commands like `/help`, `/status`, `/cvarlist` now return complete data
- **Concurrent command execution** - Support for multiple simultaneous commands with request ID tracking

### ‚ú® Added

#### Protocol & Networking
- Custom `RconProtocol` class with proper packet structure handling
- Double-packet fragmentation detection for reliable response completion
- Event-based error handling with 'error' and 'close' events
- Configurable timeout management (default 5s, extended 30s for help commands)
- Request queue management with proper cleanup on disconnect

#### Command Autocomplete Improvements
- **Fallback command system** - Common Minecraft commands available even if help parsing fails
- **Multiple help format support** - Works with vanilla, Bukkit/Spigot/Paper, and custom servers
- **Hyphenated command support** - Commands like `/titanium-rewards` now properly show parameters
- **Alternative help commands** - Tries `?` if `/help` returns empty
- **Case-insensitive command matching** - More robust parsing
- **UTF-8 color code handling** - Fixed double-byte encoding issues (√Ç¬ß sequences)

#### Terminal Rendering Fixes
- **Large output handling** - Fixed rendering corruption after commands with 300+ lines
- **Smart clearing** - Prevents duplicate suggestion lists and visual artifacts
- **Buffer overflow prevention** - Proper handling when terminal buffer scrolls
- **Full-line clearing** - Uses `\x1b[2K]` for complete line clearing
- **Cursor position tracking** - Better management after large outputs

#### Error Handling & Resilience
- Individual command failures don't break initialization
- Empty help response handling with fallbacks
- Graceful degradation when server limits RCON commands
- Continued operation with partial command lists
- Better socket error recovery

### üîß Changed

#### Core Architecture
- `rconClient.ts` now uses internal `RconProtocol` instead of external library
- Cache version bumped to 2.1.0 (incompatible with v1.x caches)
- Improved lifecycle management with proper cleanup on disconnect
- Better state tracking throughout the connection lifecycle

#### Command Parsing
- Enhanced `parseHelpResponse()` with multiple regex patterns:
  - Standard format: `/command <args>`
  - No-slash format: `command <args>`
  - Colon format: `/command: <args>`
  - List formats: `- command`
- Normalized command comparison (case-insensitive, trim whitespace)
- Special handling for commands with hyphens and underscores
- Better tokenization of nested brackets and complex parameter structures

#### Debug & Diagnostics
- Extensive logging to VS Code output channel
- Command discovery metrics (bytes received, commands found)
- Parameter parsing debug output
- Token analysis for troubleshooting
- Connection state logging

#### Terminal Improvements
- Added `lastCommandOutputLines` tracking
- Implemented `needsClearBeforeSuggestions` flag
- Better suggestion list positioning after scrolling
- Improved argument hint display with proper line clearing
- Fixed cursor save/restore sequences

### üêõ Fixed

#### Critical Issues
- **Fragmentation bug** - Responses no longer truncated at 4096 bytes
- **Help command truncation** - `/help` now returns all commands (typically 10-20KB)
- **Hyphenated commands** - Parameters now display correctly for commands with hyphens
- **Rendering corruption** - Fixed duplicate suggestion lists after large outputs
- **UTF-8 encoding** - Color codes now stripped correctly regardless of encoding

#### Terminal Issues  
- Cursor jumping after large command outputs
- Mixed text in suggestion displays
- Corrupted suggestion counter (was showing `[!!a!!/312]`)
- Incomplete line clearing causing artifacts
- ANSI escape sequence conflicts after buffer scrolling

#### Autocomplete Issues
- Empty help response crashes
- Partial command lists from fragmented responses
- Case-sensitive matching failures
- Silent initialization failures
- Missing parameters for special character commands

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

- **Removed `rcon-client` dependency** - Now using internal implementation
- **Cache format incompatible** - Version 2.1.0 cache not compatible with v1.x
- **Minimum Node.js version** - Requires Node.js 14+ for socket handling
- **Clear cache required** - Users must run `/clear-cache` after update

### üìù Technical Details

#### Packet Structure
```
+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| Size   | ID     | Type   | Body   |
| 4 bytes| 4 bytes| 4 bytes| n bytes|
+--------+--------+--------+--------+
```

#### Fragmentation Algorithm
1. Send command packet with unique ID
2. Send dummy packet immediately after
3. Accumulate all response fragments with matching ID
4. When dummy response arrives, concatenate accumulated fragments
5. Return complete response

#### Performance Metrics
- First command load: 5-10 seconds (server dependent)
- Cached load: <1 second
- Maximum response size: Unlimited (was 4096 bytes)
- Concurrent commands: Supported
- Cache validity: 7 days
