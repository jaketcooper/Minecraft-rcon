# CommandAutocomplete Updates for RCON Protocol v2

## Summary of Changes

The `commandAutocomplete.ts` file has been updated to work properly with the new custom RCON protocol implementation. The main issues addressed were:

1. **Better error handling** for fragmented help responses
2. **Improved command parsing** with multiple pattern matching
3. **Fallback commands** when help parsing fails
4. **Enhanced debugging** output for troubleshooting
5. **UTF-8 encoding fixes** for color codes

## Key Updates

### 1. Enhanced Help Response Parsing

The new implementation handles various help response formats:
- Standard `/command` format
- Alternative `command:` format
- List formats with bullets (`- command`)
- Commands followed directly by arguments

### 2. Fallback Command Support

If the help command fails or returns empty/unparseable data, the autocomplete system now:
- Tries alternative help command (`?`)
- Adds common Minecraft commands as fallbacks
- Ensures basic functionality even without server help

### 3. Better Error Recovery

- Continues loading other commands even if one fails
- Provides detailed debug output to the VS Code output channel
- Gracefully handles empty or malformed responses
- Marks the system as "ready" even with partial data

### 4. UTF-8 Color Code Handling

Fixed issues with color code stripping by handling both:
- Standard `§` character encoding
- UTF-8 double-byte `Â§` encoding

### 5. Improved Debug Output

Added extensive logging to help diagnose issues:
```typescript
this.output.appendLine(`Help response received: ${response.length} bytes`);
this.output.appendLine(`Processing ${lines.length} lines from help response`);
this.output.appendLine(`Found ${commandCount} root commands`);
```

## What This Fixes

### Problem 1: Empty Help Response
**Before**: Would crash or fail to initialize
**After**: Falls back to alternative help command or uses common commands

### Problem 2: Fragmented Help Not Fully Received
**Before**: Would only parse partial command list
**After**: New RCON protocol ensures complete response, autocomplete parses all

### Problem 3: Different Server Help Formats
**Before**: Only recognized `/command` format
**After**: Recognizes multiple formats, more compatible with different servers

### Problem 4: Silent Failures
**Before**: Would fail without explanation
**After**: Detailed output channel logging for debugging

## Testing the Updates

1. **Clear the cache first:**
   ```
   /clear-cache
   ```

2. **Reload commands:**
   ```
   /reload-commands
   ```

3. **Check the output channel for debug info:**
   - View → Output → Select "Minecraft RCON"
   - Look for lines like:
     - "Help response received: XXXX bytes"
     - "Found XX root commands"

4. **Test autocomplete:**
   - Type `/` and press Tab
   - Should see all available commands
   - Commands like `/help` should now return complete lists

## Common Minecraft Commands Added as Fallback

If help parsing fails, these commands are automatically available:

- **Game Management**: gamemode, difficulty, defaultgamemode, gamerule
- **Player Commands**: give, tp, teleport, kill, kick, ban, pardon, op, deop
- **World Commands**: time, weather, worldborder, setworldspawn, spawnpoint
- **Server Commands**: whitelist, reload, save-all, save-on, save-off, stop, list
- **Communication**: say, tell, msg, me, tellraw
- **Advanced**: execute, scoreboard, effect, enchant, xp, clear
- **Building**: fill, setblock, clone
- **Entities**: summon, data, entitydata, bossbar
- **Other**: particle, playsound, title, advancement, recipe, function

## Compatibility

The updated `commandAutocomplete.ts`:
- ✅ Works with both old and new RCON protocol
- ✅ Compatible with vanilla Minecraft servers
- ✅ Compatible with Bukkit/Spigot/Paper servers
- ✅ Handles modded servers with custom commands
- ✅ Works with servers that have large command lists

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still not loading commands
1. Check server's RCON permissions
2. Verify `/help` command is available to RCON
3. Check output channel for specific error messages
4. Try manual command: `/help` in terminal

### Issue: Some commands missing
1. The server might restrict certain commands via RCON
2. Try `/reload-commands` to refresh
3. Check if commands work when typed manually

### Issue: Autocomplete slow
1. This is normal on first load with many commands
2. Subsequent uses will be faster due to caching
3. Cache is saved for 7 days by default

## File Versions

- **Cache version**: Updated to `2.1.0` (incompatible with old caches)
- **This update requires**: Clearing old cache files
- **Backwards compatible**: Yes, with fallback support
